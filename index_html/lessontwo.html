    <p>Moreover, for each of the cells, an endospore form to resist adverse and harsh conditions such a radiation, heat, and chemicals such as disinfectants (tan and Ramamurthi, 2014). Although most species are facultative aerobes, some can be anaerobic [Prieto et al., 2014]. Several studies have revealed that some species such as Bacillus brevis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus polymyxa, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus licheniformis are capable of producing antibiotics (Hirad et al., 2013; Sawale et al., 2013; Rai et al., 2017). Some of them were extracted and used for many medical treatments, for example Tyrothricidin for sore throat infections and Polymyxin for ear inflammations [Mondol et al., 2013].
        Antibiotics are produced during the early stages of spore formation, which suggest that this phenomenon is considered as one defense mechanism of these bacterial species against other microorganisms [Sumi et al., 2015]. In addition, the antibiotics synthesized by Bacillus species can be classified into four categories according to their mechanism of action: cyclic oligopeptides (for example,bacitracin) that hinder cell wall synthesis; linear oligopeptides (for example, gramicidins and polymyxin) that interfere with cell membrane function; basic peptides (for example, edeines) that restrain the initiation complex formation on the small ribosome subunit; and aminoglycoside antibiotics that distress ribosome function [Graumann, 2012]. Various scientific literature have revealed that most Bacillus species isolated from marine sediments showed more antagonistic activities against Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, but however less toward Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa [Kannahi and Eshwari, 2016].
        This phenomenon is supported by recent studies in India and the Arabian Gulf [Parvathi et al., 2009; Hirad et al., 2013; Sawale et al., 2013]. In addition, this case could be also explained due to differences in cell wall composition of tested bacteria. Unlike Gram-positive bacteria which has only one thick layer of peptidoglycan, Gram-negative bacteria has far more complex components, in which the antimicrobial peptides must cross to interfere with its molecules required during cell wall biosynthesis ([Malanovic and Lohner, 2016].
        Moreover, lantibiotics inhibit growth of the Grampositive bacterium S. aureus via the obstruction of a carrier of peptidoglycan monomers, Lipid II, across the cytoplasm membrane to the exterior side. As a consequence, the incorporation of the growing peptidoglycan network by Lipid II is prevented during cell wall synthesis [Baruzzi et al., 2011; Sumi et al., 2015]. Another possible explanation for the antimicrobial peptidesâ€Ÿ action is that these disrupt the cell cytoplasm by binding to and aggregating with the membrane. As a result, these form pores through which ions can pass and lead to cell components leakage and eventually, cell death (Sumi et al., 2015).
        The main aim of this study was to isolate, for the first time, Bacillus species from OOU farm soils that exhibit antimicrobial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as to investigate their production in liquid media.
        
        2.1	 Screening of Antibiotic Producing Bacterial
        Antibiotics can be defined as any chemical substance of small organic molecules which at low amount are harmful to the metabolic activities and growth of other microbes [Bron and skimkets, 2000]. The natural products obtained from microorganism are still appearing as the most auspicious source of the future antibiotics [palaez, 2006]. Antibiotics which are mostly in use today are the nature derivatives of fungi and Actinomycetes [Tawiah et al., 2012].
        In nature, there is universal dissemination of antibiotics among the microorganisms responsible for their antagonism [Evanorasetr et al., 2010]. There are numbers of bacterial which are capable of producing antibiotics which include Bacillus [Waites et al., 2008]. Actinomycetes [Abdulkadri and Waliyu, 2012; Tiwari and Gupta, 2013] pseudomonas [Cartwright et al., 1995]. And Streptomyces [willey et al., 2008]. And most of these isolates are soil bacterial.
        Extensive use of antibiotics both for clinical and veterinary purpose leads to the development of resistance in many infectious strains [korboke et al., 1992]. With the continuation of this process of the process resistance, the search for new anti-infective drug should be carried out [thukur et al., 2017; brown and wright 2005]. In addition to the resistance problem, a number of new infection diseases have been discovered over the past 30 years [Zimmerman and Zimmerman, 2003; Bryskier, 2005]
        
        Soil is rich in microorganism which are capable of producing antibiotics [Bron and Skimets 2020].
        The traditional approach is random screening in which bacterial are isolated grow and their activity done for more than 50years still we are getting result in favour to us and thus we are sticking with this approach [wawrik et al., 2007].
        2.2 	Screening of soil isolates for antibiotic activity 
        A sensitivity assay was carried out to determine the antibiotic producing ability of some of the isolates against the other test organism isolated. The technique was aimed at demonstrate the alexander Flemings observation of the discovery of penicillin. For the bacteria sensitivity test, the isolate being screen for antibiotic production was streaked horizontally at a particular portion on sterile nutrient agar while the other organism on which the activity was tested against were streaked vertically very close to the screened one. Plate were incubated for 24hour at 370c, during which any substance produced by the tested organism growing perpendicularly and produce zon
