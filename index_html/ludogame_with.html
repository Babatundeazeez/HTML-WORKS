 <p> INTRODUCTION
    Bacteria are the most plentiful microbial communities in the soil, where they play fundamental roles in the maintenance of the soil ecosystem, recycling soil nutrients, minerals enrichment, nitrogen fixation, and improving the soil biogeochemical properties, which is necessary for crop production. [Delgado-Baquerizo, et al., 2018].
    The bacteria are the most abundant group usually more numerous than the four combined. Soil bacteria can be rod, (bacilli) cocci (spherical) spirilla (spirala), of
    These, bacillus are more numerous than the other. They are one of the major groups of soil bacteria population and are widely distributed. [Bhagabati A, et al., 2004].
    The number and type of bacteria present in a particular soil would be greatly influenced by geographical location such as soil temperature, soil type, soil ph. organic matter contents, cultivation, aeration and moisture content. [Davies C, et al., 1999].
    Member of the bacillus genus are generally found in soil and most of these bacterial have the ability to disintegrate protein, namely proteolytic activity. Proteases of these microorganism play an important role in the nitrogen cycles, which contributes to the fertility of the soil. In paddy field soil most of the nitrogen source is stored as biomass protein and decomposes slowly to low molecular weight amino acids by the activity of soil protease.
    Soil protease is thought to be mainly supplied by soil microorganism there are numbers of bacteria having potential to produce antibiotic, example of which is bacillus species which produce antibiotic like bacitracin, pumolin and gramicidin which are active gram positive bacteria such as staphylococci, streptococci, coryne bacter, steptomyces specie which produce antibiotic like tetracycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, gentamycin which are active against gram negative bacteria.
    Antibiotic resistance is a specific type of drug resistance virtually evolves via natural selection acting upon random mutation, but it can also be engineered by applying an evolutionary stress on a population.
    The use of antibiotic along with immunization and sterile technique in hospital has significantly decreased the number of lethal bacterial infection.
    However, antibiotic once seen as miracle drugs are now becoming useless in treating various bacterial diseases. The rapid emergence of resistance to antibiotic among pathogen generate visions of the potential post antibiotic era threating present and future medical advance
