        <P>Farming in Nigeria is a good business that one can venture into if there is a fund to maintain the farm, Nigeria is a country that is trying all its best in terms of agriculture to certify the populace.
Suppose one is looking to venture into agriculture in Nigeria. I would like to suggest vegetable farming such as Tomatoes, Pepper, Cucumber, Cabbage, etc. but the most promising one out of it is tomatoes because all homes accept this for daily consumption. Because the market is highly demanding.   
 
Tomatoes are one of the promising vegetables with high yield revenue.</P>
 <P> For the intending farmer that wants to go into farming, I suggest tomatoes farming.
If the farmer can go into the drip irrigation system and the fund to maintain the farm is available, wao……..
 It’s a gooooooooooooooal
What are you waiting for?
The drip irrigation system will allow you to farm and harvest all year round, which will allow you to cash out during surplus and scarcity in the market.
Tomatoes sell from January to December, but they have reasonable prices from April to December. During this period the price ranges from #7,000 to #12,000 per crate.
The northerner tomatoes will flood the market around January to early April, which makes the price reduce to some extent.
This shows that any farmer with any source of irrigation will be able to sell all year round.</P>
 <P> For one to achieve this at a minimum level to start with, we will have to operate on three Acres of land and use it twice a year, and each cycle of tomatoes will last for four months including the harvesting period.
During the first three months, another batch of seed will be processed in the nursery bed and done together with the first batch.
15 thousand tomato stands will occupy one Acre of land with Good Agricultural Practice at least 12 thousand plants will survive to harvest period.
To the nearest minimum, 70 crates will be getting per harvest of tomatoes on one acre of land and for a cycle, we will be getting up to 5 times of harvest.
And at least to the nearest minimum of price, one crate of tomatoes is #7,000. If we multiply this by 70 crates, we get #490,000 per harvest.
What a good investment.</P>
 <P> Let’s discuss the cost of transportation of the goods to the market
Most driver charges are based on the distance of the farm to the market and they usually charge by a unit of a crate.
Minimum of #500 per crate so we have
#500 X 70(crate) = #35,000.
The middlemen that will sell the goods at the market also collect 10% from the farmer.
10% of #7000 = #700.</P>
 <P> #700 X 70 (crate) = # 49,000.
This analysis is per market.
 
And for a cycle of tomatoes, we will have up to 5 periods to the market.
